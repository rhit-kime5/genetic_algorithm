milestone3 progress:

1. More Fitness Functions:	We added 4 more fitness functions in addition to the fitness function we already had which creates 
							a score for the chromosome based on the number of 1s for the genes. We added a countNumOf0s function 
							which works the same way as countNumOf1s but counts 0s instead of 1s. We added the fitness functions
							maxConsec1s and maxConces0s which counts the number of consecutive 1s and 0s respectively. Finally we 
							added a matchTarget fitness functions that evaluates the fitness of a chromosome based on how close it
							is to the ideal chromosome.
							
2. Selection Type Addition:	In addition to the selection type "truncation" which we already implemented, we successfully implemented
							the roulette wheel selection type. The fittest chromosomes are given the greatest probability for survival 
							when passing on genes. In the drop down menu on the evolution viewer, the user can switch between truncation
							and roulette wheel selection.
							
3. Elitism: 				The user at runtime can choose to include elitism. Here, an expressed percent of the fittest chromosomes in
							the population are copied to the next generation. We fully implemented elitism.
							
4. Crossover:				We noticed when doing test trials that the addition of crossover significantly speeds up the process of
							improving fitness than without crossover. The user can choose to implement this single point crossover at
							runtime on the evolution viewer.
							
5. Visualize the fittest:	SPECIAL FEATURE: We included a button to choose to see the fittest chromosome in the population or not
							at runtime. By clicking this button and choosing the see the fittest chromosome, the person can view the 
							fittest chromosome as the evolution viewer runs at the same time.
							
6. Terminate Condition: 	The user can enter the score at runtime that will cause the viewer to stop when the score is reached.
