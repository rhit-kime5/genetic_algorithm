milestone1 progress:

1. Load Files: .txt files with any given sequence of 0s and 1s can be loaded from the main GeneticAlgorithm class, 
				by calling the readChromosome(String filename) method. Currently, testChromosome1 has size 20,
				testChromosome2 has size 100.

2. Visualize: 	A chromosome represented in a given .txt file can be visualized from the main GeneticAlgorithm class,
				by calling the viewChromosome(String filename) method.
				
3. Mutate:		When the viewChromosome(String filename) method is called, the displayed JFrame has a Mutate button and
				a text field where the user can specify a mutation rate. Enter the desired mutation rate, press enter,
				and click the mutation button.
