milestone2 progress:

1. Runtime Save / Load: 	We were able to save and load files from the graphics interface. We created an option to 
							replace files that already exist or create brand new ones

2. User Editable Chromosome:By clicking on the squares in the chromosome viewer, we were able to change the value of
							the individual genes. This was then displayed by a change in the color of the square representing
							the genes.
							
3. Random Population: 		We are able to create a random population of 100 chromosomes, using a default chromosome constructor.

4. Fitness Function:        The fitness function creates a score from 0-100 for each chromosome based on the number of 1s for the
							genes.
							
5. Evolutionary Loop:		Were were able to generate, sort, and kill the bottom 50% of the generation. We then created random
							genes to fill the empty gene slots.
							
6. Evolution GUI: 			We created the evolution GUI that allows the viewer to see the best, average, and worst chromosomes of a 
							population over many generations and how their fitness score changes over time. All of the options for
							controlling the simulator are able to be controlled through buttons and drop downs on the evolution viewer.
							The graph updates during execution. There is a toggle start and stop, as well as a reset button in addition.
