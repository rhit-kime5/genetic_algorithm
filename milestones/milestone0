milestone0 progress:

1. Brainstorming: 						We successfully brain-stormed the possible classes for the project.

2. Assign Responibility to classes: 	We went through and decided what each class would be responsible for and got an idea
										of how to implement these responsibilities.
										
3. Construct a UML class diagram:		We constructed the UML class diagram with all the methods and field we thought we would
										need at the time.
										
4. Upload and begin:					We uploaded the UML diagram and began working on the next milestone.
